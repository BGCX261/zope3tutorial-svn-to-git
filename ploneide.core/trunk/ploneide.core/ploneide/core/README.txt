PLONE IDE
=========

My initial vision of this product is to be a plugable tool to make it easier for Plone users
to become Plone developers.

Inspiration for this comes from the bespin project and many similar products.

Roadmap'ish

0.1.0 Pluggable
---------------

Version 0.1.0 of this product is focussed on developing a mechanism for maximum plugability.
It should be easy to extend the editor using standard zope views and viewlets and if you are
more daring it should be relatively easy to add javascript products.

PloneIDE should focus on beginners. To this end...
	
	- dexterity focus
	- integration of code generation
	- integration of snippets

0.2.0 Web-sockets
-----------------

Version 0.2.0 of this product is focussed on developing a mechanism for using web-sockets in 
a Plone server. If I can get web-sockets to work, I should be able to get a debugger to work
TTW.


0.3.0 Test driven development
------------------------------
