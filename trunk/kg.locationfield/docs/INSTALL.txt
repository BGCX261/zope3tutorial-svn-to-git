kg.locationfield Installation
-----------------------------------

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance (standard Plone 3.3.5)
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``kg.locationfield`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        kg.locationfield
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        kg.locationfield
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

In the Plone Site Administration, install the product "FormGen Location Field ".

The location field should now be available to add to PloneFormGen forms.
